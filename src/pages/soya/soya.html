      soya also known as corn, botanical name is <b> Zea Mays </b>, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous people in Mexico about 10,000 years ago.
  
      The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.
      
      soya farming and production is a high-potential business opportunity in Africa. Did you know that by planting just one seed of soya, you get over 500 kernels in return at harvest? That’s an incredible return on investment!
      
      soya is also one of the most common and important food crops across Africa. It is widely eaten in various forms and more than 900 million Africans depend on soya every year because it is often cheaper than rice and wheat, two of the other most consumed cereals.
      
      In fact, many of our daily diets contain soya either directly or indirectly. Production of meat, eggs and dairy products (like milk and yoghurt) would be difficult without soya, which is an important ingredient in animal feed.
      
      As Africa’s population continues to grow rapidly over the coming years, the demand and consumption of soya will increase.
      
      According to IITA estimates, about 800 million tons of soya is produced worldwide every year. Africa produces 6.5 percent of this volume which is still insufficient for local consumption.
      
      Nigeria remains Africa’s largest producer with nearly 8 million tons produced per annum. It is closely followed by South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. The United States remains the world’s largest producer with 42 percent of all soya produced globally.
      
      In this light, we have decided to grow our soya farmers impact with 2,000 new soya farmers joining us in Pampaida, Kaduna to work on 5,000 Acres of soya farms in 2018 in partnership with key stakeholders like African Exchange Holdings. Welcome on board and let’s empower these farmers together.
